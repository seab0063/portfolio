            <h2>NHL Trade Deadline</h2>
            <p>It's that time of year again, time for the NHL trade deadline. I think it will be another pretty
                quiet trade deadline with everyone overhyping it too much. There will be some interesting
                trades made though. Some teams that I think will be sellers include the Montreal Canadiens,
                Philadelphia Flyers, Chicago Blackhawks and the Arizona Coyotes. Buyers will include the NY
                Rangers, the LA Kings, and the Nashville Predators. As for my favourite team, the Carolina
                Hurricanes, I don't think they need to do much. They have a great team as is, maybe add
                another left winger or a depth defenseman, but that's pretty much it.</p>

            <h2>Switch Sports Rant</h2>
            <p>Nintendo recently announced a sequel to Wii Sports for the Nintendo Switch, and it looks just
                awful. It completely lacks the charm of the original Wii Sports and Resort and it looks like a
                third party knockoff of those games. First off, the mii characters, who were the central focus in
                the original game, are not this time around and are replaced with these generic avatar mutants.
                The designs of everything are horrendous and ugly in every way. It shows that Nintendo doesn't
                care and they are not properly training their young designers. I will most definitely not be
                buying this game.</p>

            <h2>Mario Kart 8 DLC</h2>
            <p>Five years after its release, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is getting downloadable content. There is going
                to be a whopping 48 more tracks added, which is double the amount there already is. I am both
                excited and concerned for it. The reason I am concerned is due to the fact the art style looks a
                lot worse than the original game. The tracks all look like they are straight up ported from the
                mobile game. On top of that it will take Nintendo 2 years to get all the DLC out. If it's all just
                ported, this is straight up laziness from the company. I will still be buying it because I've waited
                far too long for new Mario Kart content.</p>
